    <h3> The hgroup element can contain only h1,...,h6 elements. Here is an example:</h3>

         <h3> <strong><i>h1 and h2</i></strong></h3>

    <hgroup>
 <h1>10 Terrific Tech Blogs by Women</h1>
 <h2>Code, Gadgets, Issues, and Science</h2>
            
 </hgroup>
    <p>
        It isn’t necessary to use an h1/h2 combination. It could be an h2/h3 or h3/h4. It <br />
        depends on where you’re putting it.  The defining attribute of hgroup elements is that <br />
        the first heading element is what goes into the document outline. The secondary heading <br />
        is not part of the outline. The secondary headings in the hgroup are meant for taglines, <br />
        subheads, and other lesser text that relates to the main heading in the hgroup.<br />
